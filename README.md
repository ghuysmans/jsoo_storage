> The Web Storage API provides mechanisms by which browsers can store key/value pairs, 
> in a much more intuitive fashion than using cookies.

-  `sessionStorage` maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's 
   available for the duration of the page session (as long as the browser is open, 
   including page reloads and restores)

-  `localStorage` does the same thing, but persists even when the browser is 
   closed and reopened.
